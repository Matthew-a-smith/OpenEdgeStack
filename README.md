# OpenEdgeStack

OpenEdgeStack is an open-source encryption library for Arduino that enables secure communication over LoRa radios without the need for LoRaWAN gateways or backend infrastructure.

---

## Compatible Hardware

This project builds on [RadioLib](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib) and provides an encryption layer for embedded edge devices.

Supported LoRa boards:
- SX126x series (SX1261, SX1262, SX1268)

---

## Usage

This library enables LoRa-style communication **without** requiring a LoRaWAN gateway or centralized network. Any LoRa-compatible device can act as a receiver.

Key Features:
- Devices join via **OTAA** (Over-the-Air Activation)
- All communication is **AES-128/CTR encrypted**
- Supports 8-byte **Device EUI** and 8-byte **HMAC** for message integrity
- Sessions are **stored in RAM** and persist across reboots
- Designed for lightweight operation between multiple edge devices and gateways

Note:
Currently, this library provides the encrypted LoRa communication layer.
A future extension is planned to add an MQTT-based console for viewing data when a network connection is available.

### Transmission Flow

```
End Device             →          Receiver (Gateway/Server)
───────────────                    ─────────────────────────────
Send JoinReq          ───────────▶  Parse & verify
Receive JoinAccept    ◀───────────  Send encrypted JoinAccept
Derive session keys
```

### Radio Module Integration
The radio module (e.g., SX1262) is accessed using a PhysicalLayer* pointer.
This allows for generic access to shared radio methods such as:

  - readData()

  - startReceive() 

### Session Management on the Gateway

Multiple end devices (sensors, nodes, etc.) can connect to a single gateway typically up to 8 or more depending on available memory.

Each device must send a valid JoinRequest() using its unique 8-byte DevEUI.

Upon acceptance, the gateway derives and stores session keys (AppSKey, NwkSKey) associated with that DevEUI.

  There's no hardcoded limit to how many devices can join The real constraints are:

  - RAM: For storing active sessions at runtime.

  - Flash: If you choose to persist sessions across reboots.

### Packet Format

```
[SenderID (8 bytes)] + [Nonce (16 bytes)] + [Encrypted Payload] + [HMAC (8 bytes)]
```
Key Notes:

  -  No padding is applied.

  -  AES-CTR encryption allows variable-length payloads.

  -  The nonce is 16 bytes: first 8 bytes are the sender's DevEUI, next 8 are random (per packet).

  -  HMAC-SHA256 is computed over [SenderID + Nonce + Encrypted Payload], then truncated to 8 bytes.

### Grouped Packet Storage

Packets can be grouped into bins and stored in memory or on disk, then transmitted later as a single encrypted blob.
This reduces transmission frequency and improves energy efficiency.

* Groups can be up to **255 bytes**
* Overflow is handled by creating new group files with prefixes

check out [**transmitterGroup**](examples/transmitterGroup/transmitterGroup.ino) from example for more info on it.

## Normal messages
You can also send messages immediately (without grouping), and they’ll still be encrypted.

Their is also a poll send as well that acts a delay for sending.

## FAQ

**1) What libraries are required?**
This library builds on top of [RadioLib](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib). It handles encryption and addressing only — radio handling is left to the underlying library.

```cpp
#include <RadioLib.h>

//Optional used for perstiance and storage
#include <Preferences.h>
#include <FS.h>
#include <SPIFFS.h>
#include <map>
```

**2) Can other radios see the packets I’m sending?**
Yes, if another LoRa radio is configured identically and in range, it can receive packets — but all data is encrypted and HMAC-verified. Check out the wiki for a full breakdown of how the encrypttion and the hmac keys help protect data in transit.

**3) How is this different from LoRaWAN?**
This is a lightweight “LoRaWAN Lite” model. You don’t need to rely on an official gateway or backend server. Instead, any LoRa device can act as your gateway. Ideal for rural, offline, or minimal setups.

**4) Which frequencies can I use?**
Refer to [this LoRaWAN frequency table](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/LoRaWAN/Frequencies/By-Country) and your hardware datasheet. Always comply with your country’s legal duty cycle limits.
